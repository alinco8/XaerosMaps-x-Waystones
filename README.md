## What is this?

Allows you to view Waystones on Xaero's Minimap/World Map.  
Icons, colors, and other options can be customized from the mod’s Config.  
You can also press the Mods button, select this mod, and then press the Config button to change
settings in-game.  
Most settings require rejoining the world to take effect.

This mod adds compatibility between Xaero's Minimap/World Map and Waystones, allowing you to easily
view the locations of your Waystones on the map.

I’m a beginner in mod development and multi-loader/multi-version development.
Bug reports and feature requests are **very welcome**!

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> All waypoints created by this mod are **Temporary** and will be removed when you rejoin the world.

> resource packs.
